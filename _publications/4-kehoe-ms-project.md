excerpt: 'This project focuses on exploring different computational methods of the Riemann Zeta function. The zeta function is formally defined as $\zeta(s)$ and the Riemann Hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeroes of $\zeta(s)$ lie inside the critical line where $\Re(s) = 1/2$. Modern research and advanced algorithms have not been able to disprove the Riemann Hypothesis. More recently, a variation of the Odlyzko--–Schönhage algorithm has verified the Riemann Hypothesis up to $10^{13}$ zeroes. This project is composed of two major programs to calculate functional values and zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The first program calculates $\zeta(s)$ for any value of $s$ provided $s\in\mathbb{R}$ through what is known as the Cauchy-Schlömilch transformation. The second program uses the well known Riemann--Siegel formula. Prior to the work done inside the Odlyzko--Schönhage algorithm algorithm, this was the method of choice for finding zeroes of $\zeta(s)$. This algorithm itself is heavily dependent on locating sign changes for the Riemann-Siegel $Z$ function which is known as $Z(t)$. The sign changes of $Z(t)$ directly relate to zeroes on the critical line. Loosely speaking, one can derive this formula from a direct relationship that was originally derived by Siegel. The relationship shows that $Z(t) = e^{i \theta(t)} \zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)$. Further investigation is done on a procedure known as Lehmer's Phenomenon which may potentially disprove the Riemann Hypothesis.

Abstract: This project focuses on exploring different computational methods of the Riemann Zeta function. The zeta function is formally defined as $\zeta(s)$ and the Riemann Hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeroes of $\zeta(s)$ lie inside the critical line where $\Re(s) = 1/2$. Modern research and advanced algorithms have not been able to disprove the Riemann Hypothesis. More recently, a variation of the Odlyzko--–Schönhage algorithm has verified the Riemann Hypothesis up to $10^{13}$ zeroes. This project is composed of two major programs to calculate functional values and zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The first program calculates $\zeta(s)$ for any value of $s$ provided $s\in\mathbb{R}$ through what is known as the Cauchy-Schlömilch transformation. The second program uses the well known Riemann--Siegel formula. Prior to the work done inside the Odlyzko--Schönhage algorithm algorithm, this was the method of choice for finding zeroes of $\zeta(s)$. This algorithm itself is heavily dependent on locating sign changes for the Riemann-Siegel $Z$ function which is known as $Z(t)$. The sign changes of $Z(t)$ directly relate to zeroes on the critical line. Loosely speaking, one can derive this formula from a direct relationship that was originally derived by Siegel. The relationship shows that $Z(t) = e^{i \theta(t)} \zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)$. Further investigation is done on a procedure known as Lehmer's Phenomenon which may potentially disprove the Riemann Hypothesis. The author is exploring further enhancements in the Julia programming language.
