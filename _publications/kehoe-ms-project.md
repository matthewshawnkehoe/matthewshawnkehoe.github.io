The Zeta function is an extremely important part of mathematics and is formally defined as $\zeta(s)$.

The first program calculates $\zeta(s)$ for any value of s provided $s\in\mathbb{R}$. This program uses a rather straightforward approach for calculating all values of $\zeta(s)$. The main difficulty deals with implementing a recursive method which will handle all values calculated between ${-2}\leq{\Re}(s)\leq{2}$. I used an alternative method known as the Cauchy--–Schl$\ddot{o}$milch transformation. Further details behind the mathematics involved inside the transformation are shown inside the appendix.

The second program uses the well known Riemann--Siegel formula. Prior to the work done inside the Odlyzko--–Sch$\ddot{o}$nhage algorithm, this was the method of choice for finding zeroes of $\zeta(s)$. This algorithm itself is heavily dependent on locating sign changes for the Riemann-Siegel Z function which is known as Z(t). The sign changes of Z(t) directly relate to zeroes on the critical line. Loosely speaking, one can derive this formula from a direct relationship that was originally derived by Siegel. The relationship shows that $Z(t) = e^{i \theta(t)} \zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)$. I have also decided to investigate what is known as Lehmer's Phenomenon. This was found by D. H. Lehmer in 1956, the phenomenon references when two zeros of the zeta function are so close together that it is unusually difficult to find a sign change between them.

The third program is variation of the Euler-Maclaurin Summation formula. This is the slowest of all widely known methods to calculate zeroes for $\zeta(s)$. The main motivation for writing this program is out of mere curiosity. Similar to the first implementation, I will introduce a non-standard way of implementing the Zeta function.

While writing computer programs is enjoyable, it is important to point out an important proof made by G.H. Hardy in 1915. This is known as Hardy's Theorem and states that an infinite amount of zeroes lie inside the critical line where $\Re(s) = 1/2$. Considering we have already found $10^{13}$ zeroes, it is highly unlikely modern computers will disprove the hypothesis. We will likely need to change the approach by which $\zeta(s)$ is evaluated.'

Abstract: The purpose of this project is to explore different computational methods of the Riemann Zeta function. Modern analysis shows that a variety of different methods have been used to compute values for the Zeta function and its zeroes. I am looking to develop multiple programs that will find non-trivial zeroes and specific function values. All computer implementations have been done inside the Java programming language. One could easily transfer the programs written inside the appendix to the preferred language of choice. My main motivation for writing these programs is because I am interested in learning more about the mathematics behind the Zeta function and its zeroes.

The Zeta function is an extremely important part of mathematics and is formally defined as $\zeta(s)$. The Riemann Hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeroes of $\zeta(s)$ lie inside the critical line where $\Re(s) = 1/2$. It is important to note that by definition all non-trivial zeroes are bounded to the critical strip of ${0}\leq{\Re}(s)\leq{1}$. Modern research and advanced algorithms have not been able to disprove the hypothesis. Recent research has produced what is known as the Odlyzko--–Sch$\ddot{o}$nhage algorithm. The algorithm has been used to verify the Riemann Hypothesis up to $10^{13}$ zeroes. To investigate properties of the Zeta function, I read modern literature and wrote several software applications.

The first program calculates $\zeta(s)$ for any value of s provided $s\in\mathbb{R}$. This program uses a rather straightforward approach for calculating all values of $\zeta(s)$. The main difficulty deals with implementing a recursive method which will handle all values calculated between ${-2}\leq{\Re}(s)\leq{2}$. I used an alternative method known as the Cauchy--–Schl$\ddot{o}$milch transformation. Further details behind the mathematics involved inside the transformation are shown inside the appendix.

The second program uses the well known Riemann--Siegel formula. Prior to the work done inside the Odlyzko--–Sch$\ddot{o}$nhage algorithm, this was the method of choice for finding zeroes of $\zeta(s)$. This algorithm itself is heavily dependent on locating sign changes for the Riemann-Siegel Z function which is known as Z(t). The sign changes of Z(t) directly relate to zeroes on the critical line. Loosely speaking, one can derive this formula from a direct relationship that was originally derived by Siegel. The relationship shows that $Z(t) = e^{i \theta(t)} \zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)$.
