This talk analyzed the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic) to develop a supervised machine learning classification model that predicts whether breast masses are benign or malignant based on cellular characteristics extracted from digitized images. Several algorithms were tested including Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost, with Logistic Regression emerging as the best performer, improving accuracy from a baseline of 62.6% to 98.25%. The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning for breast cancer diagnosis and suggests further research directions including applying similar techniques to other cancer types, comparing with other datasets, adding features like age and health, and analyzing feature-feature correlations.
