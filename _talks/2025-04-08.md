This presentation covered the process of generating song lyrics by fine-tuning a custom GPT-2 model on lyrics from specific artists such as Blink-182 and Weird Al Yankovic. It covered data scraping, preprocessing, model training using the Hugging Face Transformers library, and generating structured lyrical content. The workflow concluded with training a custom GPT model specifically on Taylor Swift lyrics to produce original lyrics in her style.
