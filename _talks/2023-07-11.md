Deep learning methods offer a lot of promise for time series forecasting, such as the automatic learning of temporal dependence and the automatic handling of temporal structures like trends and seasonality. This talk discussed how neural networks are able to automatically learn arbitrary complex mappings from inputs to outputs and support multiple inputs and outputs.
