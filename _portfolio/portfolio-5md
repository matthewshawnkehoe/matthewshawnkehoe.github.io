Created a personalized travel recommender system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to analyze TripAdvisor reviews. By extracting insights from user-generated content, the system leverages LLMs to understand preferences and trends in travel behavior. This enables it to deliver highly accurate and tailored destination recommendations. The project combines NLP and LLMs to enhance the relevance of travel suggestions, offering a more intuitive way for users to explore new destinations.
