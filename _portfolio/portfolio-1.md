The scattering of electromagnetic radiation by a layered periodic diffraction grating is a central model in engineering and the sciences. The numerical simulation of this experiment has been widely explored in the literature and we advocate for a novel interfacial method which is perturbative in nature. This repository contains a High–Order Perturbation of Surfaces/Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (HOPS/AWE) algorithm which is well–suited for PDEs posed on piecewise homogeneous domains.
