Hello! I'm a research scientist at [Michigan Tech Research Institute](https://www.mtu.edu/mtri/) in Ann Arbor, MI with a background in numerical analysis, computational electromagnetics, and machine learning. I believe in collaborative science and technology, and strive to promote diversity, innovation, and inclusivity. My goal is to advance scientific knowledge and make a positive impact on society through developing open source software and promoting scientific computing.

## My Work and Research
I employ qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to design and enhance algorithms, with a focus on non-proprietary software, scientific research, and automation of mundane tasks. My previous work has spanned diverse areas of computer science and applied mathematics. In terms of academic research, my interests lie in acoustics, fluid mechanics, high-performance computing, and partial differential equations. I'm particularly drawn to [calculating zeros of the Riemann zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis#Zeros_on_the_critical_line) and studying [wave scattering in periodic media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_scattering_theory). I'm passionate about mentoring students and enjoy delving into the theoretical aspects of mathematical analysis.

## My Background and History
I hold a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from UIC's [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](https://mscs.uic.edu/), an M.S. in [Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://umdearborn.edu/casl/graduate-programs/programs/master-science-applied-and-computational-mathematics) from UM-Dearborn, and a B.A. from Oakland University's [College of Arts and Sciences](https://oakland.edu/business/undergraduate-majors-minors/economics/). I had the privilege of being mentored by [David Nicholls](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~nicholls/) and [Frank Massey](http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~fmassey/). Before completing my doctorate, I worked in industry as a software consultant at [Workforce Software](https://workforcesoftware.com/) and completed a [NSF Mathematical Sciences Graduate Internship](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/nsf-mathematical-sciences-graduate-internship) at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) and the [Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Locations/CRREL/). My long-term goal is to further my expertise in numerical analysis and develop innovative theorems and computational techniques.

## My Communities
When I'm not working on my research, I like to stay active and pursue my interests in running and astronomy. I'm an enthusiastic member of the [Ann Arbor Running Club](https://www.annarborrunningcompany.com/pages/group-runs) and have completed several half marathons in [Michigan](https://dxa2.com/) and [Chicago](https://www.chicagohalfmarathon.com/). I'm also passionate about stargazing and enjoy being part of the [UIC Astronomy Club](https://astroclubatuic.weebly.com/) and the [Warren Astronomical Society](https://warrenastro.org/). Teaching mathematics is another activity that brings me joy, and I'm excited to get back to my weekend tutoring sessions with like-minded peers.
